# Trains-A-GoGo

For the train schedule I used firebase to take in information and then recalled that information back to the page in a 

readable schedule. I used both bootstrap for page layout. I used jquery and moment.js to write the code for the page. 



I took in information from a user in a form, which was then saved to firebase. The information that was input is then 

recalled to the page while using moment.js to help calculate the time, to let the user know when in real time the next 

train will come.
